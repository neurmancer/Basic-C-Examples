## A BASIC C SCRIPT FILE FOR BEGINNERS(ME lulz) 

- Added a hello, world script
- Added a Basic FizzBuzz script
- Added a basic prime number counter with user input
- Added a Function Pointer introduction Lecture (honestly it's not the best practice to use them this way but good for seeing syntax)

## Added funny things

- Bring Me To Life lyrics spitter for CLI and will be improved
- - Full extend of lyrics and better timing will be added 

- BEHOLD EMO JUKEBOX HAS BEEN ADDED WITH A VAST(not so vast tho) SET OF SONGS YOU CAN PRINT ON YOUR CLI DRAMATICALLY SLOW FOR THE PERFECT EMO VIBES (and please don't blank enter it makes me sad...) (now it has it's own section a little down)

- A program that gives you an output file and spits a text on terminal anyways because I used stderr instead of stdout

- And a Loading bar will give you Easter Eggs based on RNG(That's for you little gamblers)

- An important program added.(it needs to load shit first.)

## ADDED ASM DISASSEMBLIES OF FILES FOR THOSE LOW-LEVEL GREMLINS LIKE ME LOVES SPICY C NUDES

- Basically Every script I'll put in the repo will get it's assembly file with the same name 
- I may add -O2 flag to make it torturing to get what even the program was in the first place if I feel like it




# SHITTY JUKEBOX V2 DROPPED
- Old rock/metal song lyrics now with RGB lyrics option
- Nightcore on crack some cool old musics that roots back to early 2010s (and if you have 2 monitors I strongly advise using with DVD Screensaver) forced RGB lyrics
- A jukebox ascii art at the bottom and lyrics on the top of the code
- Interactive loop 
- %10 chance of getting rickrolled as you try to exit and brick Ctrl+C 'till it is done
- New features will be added 'cuz why not?
- Uses prime numbers to determine if you want RGB or not becasuse I still don't know how to use structs and don't feel like rushing it.It'll be added when I learn

## Compiling & Running
```bash
#To compile use:
cc/gcc ShittyJukeBox -o filename.out -lm #for math lib
#To run
./filename.o #Then have fun
```

## Compile&Run (basically for every file in this repo)
```bash

#For the ones don't know how to compile and run 
#if there is additional lib/flag for any specific file it will be commented within file itself.

cc filename.c -o output #To compile

./output 
#To run (but since all the files written for 
#Linux and don't have Windows ports I presume you already know to do this because windows sux)
