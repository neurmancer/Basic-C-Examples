## A BASIC C SCRIPT FILE FOR BEGINNERS(ME lulz) 

- Added a hello, world script
- Added a Basic FizzBuzz script
- Added a basic prime number counter with user input
- Added a Function Pointer introduction Lecture (honestly it's not the best practice to use them this way but good for seeing syntax)
- Added a subfolder named RNG for basic rand() applications
- Added a basic heads or tails program (with explanations)
- Added a guess game
- Added a D6 roller (Now go implement you D20 DND freaks)
- Added a basic pointer101 lecture with syntax and detailed explanations without making it scary (yet)
- Added a second pointer lecture and moved the pointer shit into a subfolder called Pointerhell
- Added a Magic 8Ball thingy that roasts you

## Added funny things

- Bring Me To Life lyrics spitter for CLI and will be improved
- - Full extend of lyrics and better timing will be added 

- BEHOLD EMO JUKEBOX HAS BEEN ADDED WITH A VAST(not so vast tho) SET OF SONGS YOU CAN PRINT ON YOUR CLI DRAMATICALLY SLOW FOR THE PERFECT EMO VIBES (and please don't blank enter it makes me sad...) (now it has it's own section a little down)

- A program that gives you an output file and spits a text on terminal anyways because I used stderr instead of stdout

- And a Loading bar will give you Easter Eggs based on RNG(That's for you little gamblers)

- An important program added.(it needs to load shit first.)

## ADDED ASM DISASSEMBLIES OF FILES FOR THOSE LOW-LEVEL GREMLINS LIKE ME LOVES SPICY C NUDES

- Basically Every script I'll put in the repo will get it's assembly file with the same name 
- I may add -O2 flag to make it torturing to get what even the program was in the first place if I feel like it
- Fresh C nudes came (17.02.2026 00.02AM)



# SHITTY JUKEBOX V3 DROPPED
- Old rock/metal song lyrics now with RGB lyrics option
- Nightcore on crack some cool old musics that roots back to early 2010s (and if you have 2 monitors I strongly advise using with DVD Screensaver) forced RGB lyrics
- A jukebox ascii art at the bottom and lyrics on the top of the code
- Interactive loop 
- %10 chance of getting rickrolled as you try to exit and brick Ctrl+C 'till it is done
- Uses prime numbers to determine if you want RGB or not. And unfortunately I learned structs...from now on no more Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel fueled enless prime number usage...
- Now apperantly it got it's own windows branch which I'll provide with .exe file too since Win users don't know what a compiler is.
- WindowsPORT has it's own branch called winPORTsux which I won't merge(and since I started to C 5 days ago. That port is possible thanks to Grok(taught me what IFNDEF is))
- Now with a ASCII JUKEBOX in Genre Menu (fullscreen advised by me lol as developer yk I'd do as I say if I were you)
- Now the V3 is untoby-fox'd (killed the switch you may wanna call it killswitch ;) pun intended...I mean I am makin shitty emo/nightcore jukebox for CLI don't expect good jokes)
- winPORTsux won't get update in this repo anymore (you know why it is.)
- AND **FRESH ASM NUDES** of the current version in the asmCNudes folder for low-level pervs.



### SHITTY JUKEBOX IS GOT IT'S OWN REPO
- Due to my obssession overgrowing the 'basic' in the basic repo shitty jukebox will get it's own repo with new features and possible updated winSUXport.

- Here it is: https://github.com/neurmancer/ShittyJukeBoxCLI 
- - I do explain shit so much for someone doesn't have people to read right?



## Compile&Run (basically for every file in this repo)
```bash

#For the ones don't know how to compile and run 
#if there is additional lib/flag for any specific file it will be commented within file itself.

cc filename.c -o output #To compile

./output 
#To run (but since all the files written for 
#Linux and don't have Windows ports I presume you already know to do this because windows sux)
