- Added a second pointer lecture and moved the pointer shit into a subfolder called Pointerhell
- Added a pointer&function relation lecture

## Funny Things

- Bring Me To Life lyrics spitter for CLI (prototype shitty jukebox from day 3)

- A program that gives you an output file and spits a text on terminal anyways because I used stderr instead of stdout

- Added a walking segfault PTSD on purpose 


## ASM DISASSEMBLIES OF FILES FOR THOSE LOW-LEVEL GREMLINS LIKE ME LOVES SPICY C NUDES

- Basically Every script I'll put in the repo will get it's assembly file with the same name 
- I may add -O2 flag to make it torturing to get what even the program was in the first place if I feel like it
- Fresh C nudes came (17.02.2026 00.02AM)




### SHITTY JUKEBOX IS GOT IT'S OWN REPO
- Due to my obssession overgrowing the 'basic' in the basic repo shitty jukebox will get it's own repo with new features and possible updated winSUXport.

- Here it is: https://github.com/neurmancer/ShittyJukeBoxCLI 
- - I do explain shit so much for someone doesn't have people to read right?



## Compile and Run
```bash

#For the ones don't know how to compile and run 
#if there is additional lib/flag for any specific file it will be commented within file itself.

cc filename.c -o output #To compile

./output 
#To run (but since all the files written for 
#Linux and don't have Windows ports I presume you already know to do this because windows sux)
```
