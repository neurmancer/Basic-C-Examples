## A BASIC C SCRIPT FILE FOR BEGINNERS(ME lulz) 

- Added a hello, world program
- Added a basic prime number counter with user input

## Added funny things

- Bring Me To Life lyrics spitter for CLI and will be improved
- - Full extend of lyrics and better timing will be added 

- A program that gives you an output file and spits a text on terminal anyways because I used stderr instead of stdout

- And a Loading bar will give you Easter Eggs based on RNG(That's for you little gamblers)


## Compile&Run (basically for every file in this repo)
```bash

#For the ones don't know how to compile and run

cc filename.c -o output #To compile

./output 
#To run (but since all the files written for 
#Linux and don't have Windows ports I presume you already know to do this because windows sux)
