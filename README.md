## A BASIC C SCRIPT FILE FOR BEGINNERS(ME lulz) 

- Added a hello, world program
- Added a basic prime number counter with user input
- Added a Function Pointer introduction Lecture (honestly it's not the best practice to use them this way but good for seeing syntax)

## Added funny things

- Bring Me To Life lyrics spitter for CLI and will be improved
- - Full extend of lyrics and better timing will be added 

- BEHOLD EMO JUKEBOX HAS BEEN ADDED WITH A VAST(not so vast tho) SET OF SONGS YOU CAN PRINT ON YOUR CLI DRAMATICALLY SLOW FOR THE PERFECT EMO VIBES (and please don't blank enter it makes me sad...) 

- A program that gives you an output file and spits a text on terminal anyways because I used stderr instead of stdout

- And a Loading bar will give you Easter Eggs based on RNG(That's for you little gamblers)

- An important program added.(it needs to load shit first.)

## ADDED ASM DISASSEMBLIES OF FILES FOR THOSE LOW-LEVEL GREMLINS LIKE ME LOVES SPICY C NUDES

- Basically Every script I'll put in the repo will get it's assembly file with the same name 
- I may add -O2 flag to make it torturing to get what even the program was in the first place if I feel like it


## Compile&Run (basically for every file in this repo)
```bash

#For the ones don't know how to compile and run 
#if there is additional lib/flag for any specific file it will be commented within file itself.

cc filename.c -o output #To compile

./output 
#To run (but since all the files written for 
#Linux and don't have Windows ports I presume you already know to do this because windows sux)
