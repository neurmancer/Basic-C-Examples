## THIS IS THE LAST TIME WINDOWS PORT GETTING SHIT EITHER LEARN HOW USE VM OR WSL OR WATCH LINUX USERS ENJOYING THEIR SEIZURES

- Added shittyJukeBox.exe in /bin folder(c'mon only subfolder in directory not rocket science)
- Added a 32bit version for WinXP users (better than Win11 tho ngl)
- Fixed a few tiny things I won't care to explain
- Have fun 
- And before I forget know you too can get rickrolled
-Final note: I didn't care to get a app signature or shit I started coding 5 days ago so if you really wanna run just click on "Run anyways" or shit I don't know how to write malware yet anyways.I don't use Windows.
