/* ==================== NSD / MAPPING CONTROL ===================
    Request a region. Check the result. Write two nodes. Walk the chain.
    Release the mapping. That's the operation, including cleanup.
    I don't leave live pointers aimed at memory I've already handed back.
    Some other allocation can occupy that address later. Bad place to get lazy.
    Build: gcc -g -nostdlib -no-pie -x assembler 09_mmap_and_structs_in_the_wild.asm -o /tmp/mapping
    Run /tmp/mapping; echo $?     Expected 0; mapping errors give 1.

    mmap requests a virtual-memory mapping. malloc usually subdivides larger
    regions and keeps bookkeeping; one mmap per tiny object is not an
    efficient malloc replacement. See descend/but_wtf_malloc_actually_is.c
    for Neuro's sbrk-based allocator experiment elsewhere in this repo.

    Linux mmap args: address hint, length, protection, flags, fd, offset.
    NULL hint lets kernel choose. PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE means readable/writable.
    MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS gives a private zero-initialized mapping without
    backing file; fd=-1, offset=0. Permissions deliberately exclude execute.
    Kernel rounds mapping length to page boundaries. We request 32 bytes;
    the object capacity is still 32. Page rounding isn't authorization to
    write past the object. Track the size you actually requested.
    munmap requires the page-aligned base and a nonzero length; matching our
    original requested length releases the mapping here.

    C model on Linux AMD64:
        struct node {
            int value;          // offset 0, 4 bytes
                                // offset 4, 4 bytes padding
            struct node *next;  // offset 8, 8 bytes
        };                      // total 16, alignment 8
    Assembly has no automatic struct layout unless we define one ourselves.
    Padding is space for alignment, not a secret member. If sharing with C,
    verify sizeof/offsetof and packing settings. Layout is part of the interface.
    A char, then a pointer is NOT necessarily offsets 0 and 1 in normal C.

/*
    Allocation record:
        mappings acquired: 1 if mmap succeeds
        mappings released: 1 on normal and internal-check cleanup paths
        pointers used after unmap: 0. Released means stop fucking touching it.

    This walk trusts the two nodes WE constructed. A general list imported
    from arbitrary bytes needs bounds, lifetime and cycle handling. Reading
    a forged next pointer means following an address supplied by bad data.
    Establish validity before dereferencing. The MMU won't validate your list.
    .data/.bss addresses last for process lifetime; stack locals for their
    frame; allocated regions until released. Same C lifetime idea, manually.
    Exercise: add a third node with -1, enlarge mapping request, expect 65.
    Then use offsets instead of absolute next pointers and explain why that
    representation is easier to serialize or move to a different base.
