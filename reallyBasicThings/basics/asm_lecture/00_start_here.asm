    warranty : already fucking void

    Crash here. Neuro runs this repo. I've got the hardware desk.
    asmCNudes shows what the compiler left behind. We're taking over the
    instruction stream ourselves. Registers, addresses, flags, every byte
    accounted for. The machine will execute exactly what you encode, even
    when what you encode is spectacularly stupid. Learn to read the evidence.

    SOFTWARE ENDS SOMEWHERE. I WORK THERE.

    Before you touch the console:
        0- These are Linux x86-64 programs. Intel OR AMD CPU, both fine.
        1- Syntax is GNU assembler (GAS), Intel operand order.
        2- Everything that teaches the lecture lives in these comments.
        3- Read in numeric order. Each example is its own program.
        4- Basic C knowledge helps. No previous assembly knowledge needed.

    x86 is a family, not a promise that every file runs on your 8086.
    We're primarily using its 64-bit mode (AMD64 / Intel 64). Chapter 14
    gives 32-bit x86 its own runnable example and explains the differences.
    Windows x64 has a different ABI. ARM has a different instruction set.
    A renamed file doesn't change the target. Check the architecture first.
    I work on bare metal too; this operation runs under Linux in userspace.
    Keep that boundary straight. An edgy banner doesn't grant ring 0.

    ======================= HOW TO RUN ========================

    From THIS directory:
        make
        ./build/00_start_here

    Tools: GNU make, GCC, GNU binutils.
    GDB is optional for execution. For interrogation, keep it within reach.
    To build just this file without the Makefile:
        gcc -g -x assembler 00_start_here.asm -o /tmp/asm_intro
        /tmp/asm_intro

    Why -x assembler? GCC doesn't automatically treat .asm as assembly.
    .s normally means assembly; .S means assembly with C preprocessing.
    We explicitly choose plain assembly. No C preprocessor on this route.
    The assembler translates instructions into machine-code bytes.
    The linker joins objects, resolves symbols and creates an ELF binary.
    GCC here is a driver arranging those steps and linking libc for main.
    It does NOT translate this into C first. Assembly goes to the assembler.

    Most chapters use _start and skip libc. Their command is:
        gcc -g -nostdlib -no-pie -x assembler FILE.asm -o /tmp/thingy
    Chapters 00 and 06 use main and the ordinary GCC link command instead.
    Build these files separately. Each supplies its own entry point;
    linking them together gives duplicate symbols. Check the build command.

    ======================== ROADMAP ==========================

    00 - This file: CPU / assembler / OS, syntax, first libc call.
    01 - Registers, widths, partial writes, signedness, extensions.
    02 - Sections, addresses, dereferencing, arrays, little endian.
    03 - Arithmetic, flags, carry chains, multiplication and division.
    04 - Comparisons, branches, loops, masks, shifts and rotates.
    05 - Stack, call/ret, saved registers, locals and recursion.
    06 - System V ABI, printf, seven arguments, calling C and PIE.
    07 - Byte strings, explicit lengths, rep instructions and DF.
    08 - Raw Linux read/write, EOF, short writes and errors.
    09 - mmap/munmap, struct layout and a tiny linked list.
    10 - Floating point and SSE2 SIMD without AVX prerequisites.
    11 - Atomic operations, cmpxchg, CPU ordering and limitations.
    12 - Final project: argv parsing + FizzBuzz + decimal formatting.
    13 - GDB, ELF, relocations, instruction bytes and performance.
    14 - Optional 32-bit program. Legacy target, different ABI.

    Chapters 01-05, 07, 09-11 and 13 are quiet on success. Check the
    exit status with echo $? IMMEDIATELY afterwards. Zero = worked.
    53 = our internal check failed. 13 = bad input in the final project.
    1 = I/O or mapping failure. Shell status only keeps the low 8 bits,
    so 689 gets truncated. The shell doesn't care about NSD's favorite numbers.

    =================== WHAT THE CPU SEES =====================

    C says: x += 5;
    Assembly might say: add eax, 5
    The CPU sees encoded bytes. Variable names and comments aren't CPU
    features; they're the annotations we leave for the next operator.

    An instruction set (ISA) specifies visible behavior: registers,
    instructions, flags. A microarchitecture is HOW a particular CPU
    implements that contract: caches, pipelines, execution units etc.
    One assembly instruction is not necessarily one cycle or one internal
    operation. Fewer lines doesn't automatically mean faster. Bring measurements.
    'Looks faster' is marketing. I don't take performance reports from marketing.

    Registers hold working values. Memory is addressed byte by byte.
    RIP tracks instruction execution. RFLAGS holds condition/status bits.
    The OS gives our process virtual memory and controls privileged work.
    Writing assembly does not grant root or let you casually touch hardware.
    Ring 3 is userspace; ring 0 is kernel privilege. syscall asks the kernel
    to do something under its rules. Your process still has to pass its checks.

    ====================== WIRE FORMAT ========================

    GAS Intel syntax:      mov eax, 13       destination, source
    GAS AT&T syntax:       movl $13, %eax    source, destination
    NASM Intel syntax:     mov eax, 13       similar instruction spelling

    But directives differ! GAS uses .section, .byte, .quad, .globl;
    NASM commonly uses section, db, dq, global. Don't paste NASM directives
    into GAS and blame the CPU. Wrong toolchain, wrong result. Comments here are
    slash-star blocks or # line comments; semicolon separates statements.

    Label: a name for a position. No bytes consumed by the label itself.
    Directive: an instruction to the assembler, usually starts with a dot.
    Mnemonic: a readable CPU operation name, such as mov, add, call, ret.
    Immediate: a literal number encoded in the instruction, such as 13.
    Register operand: eax. Memory operand: DWORD PTR [rip + some_label].
    PTR is an operand-size annotation, not a C pointer declaration.

    I'll explain each instruction when we reach it. Keep the manual open
    for exact behavior. You don't need to memorize it; you need to stop
    guessing when the answer is sitting in the fucking specification.

    Technical records (datasheets are long threat letters; read the terms):
    GAS syntax/directives: https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/
    ISA manuals: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html
    System V AMD64 ABI: https://gitlab.com/x86-psABIs/x86-64-ABI
    Linux syscall ABI: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscall.2.html
    GDB: https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html/
    The ABI and manuals define the contract. Even Crash has to obey the pins.

/*
    Exercise: change the greeting, build again, observe what changes.
    Then objdump -d -Mintel /tmp/asm_intro and find main.
    There's extra startup code because libc programs have a runtime around
    them. Next chapter we enter at _start and handle termination ourselves.
    One abstraction removed. Keep going.
